Motivation for asteval
########################

The asteval module allows you to evaluate a large subset of the Python language
from within a python program, without using :py:func:`eval`.  It is, in effect,
a restricted version of Python's built-in :py:func:`eval`, forbidding several
actions, and using a simple dictionary as a flat namespace.  A completely fair
question is: Why is this desirable?  That is, why not simply use
:py:func:`eval`, or just use Python itself?

The short answer is that sometimes you want to allow evaluation of user input,
or expose a simple or even scientific calculator inside a larger application.
For this, :py:func:`eval` is pretty scary, as it exposes *all* of Python, which
makes user input difficult to trust.  Since asteval does not support the
**import** statement (unless explicitly enabled) or many other constructs, user
code cannot access the :py:mod:`os` and :py:mod:`sys` modules or any functions
or classes outside those provided in the symbol table.

Many of the other missing features (modules, classes, lambda, yield,
generators) are similarly motivated by a desire for a safer version of
:py:func:`eval`.  The idea for asteval is to make a simple procedural,
mathematically-oriented language that can be embedded into larger applications.

In fact, the asteval module grew out the the need for a simple expression
evaluator for scientific applications such as the `lmfit`_ and `xraylarch`_
modules.  An early attempt using the pyparsing module worked but was
error-prone and difficult to maintain.  While the simplest of calculators or
expressiona-evaluators is not hard with pyparsing, it turned out that using the
Python :py:mod:`ast` module makes it much easier to implement a feature-rich
scientific calculator, including slicing, complex numbers, keyword arguments to
functions, etc. In fact, this approach meant that adding more complex
programming constructs like conditionals, loops, exception handling, and even
user-defined functions was fairly simple.  An important benefit of using the
:py:mod:`ast` module is that whole categories of implementation errors
involving parsing, lexing, and defining a grammar disappear.  Any valid python
expression will be parsed correctly and converted into an Abstract Syntax Tree.
Furthermore, the resulting AST is easy to walk through, greatly simplifying the
evaluation process.  What started as a desire for a simple expression evaluator
grew into a quite useable procedural domain-specific language for mathematical
applications.

Asteval makes no claims about speed. Evaluating the AST involves many
function calls, which is going to be slower than Python - often 4x slower
than Python.  That said, for certain use cases (see
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34106484), use of asteval and numpy can
approach the speed of `eval` and the `numexpr` modules.

How Safe is asteval?
=======================

Asteval avoids all of the exploits we know about that make :py:func:`eval`
dangerous. For reference, see, `Eval is really dangerous
<http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html>`_ and the
comments and links therein.  From this discussion it is apparent that not only
is :py:func:`eval` unsafe, but that it is a difficult prospect to make any
program that takes user input perfectly safe.  In particular, if a user can
cause Python to crash with a segmentation fault, safety cannot be guaranteed.
Asteval explicitly forbids the exploits described in the above link, and works
hard to prevent malicious code from crashing Python or accessing the
underlying operating system.  That said, we cannot guarantee that asteval is
completely safe from malicious code.  We claim only that it is safer than the
builtin :py:func:`eval`, and that you might find it useful.

Some of the things not allowed in the asteval interpreter for safety reasons include:

  * importing modules.  Neither 'import' nor '__import__' are supported by
    default.  If you do want to support 'import' and 'import from', you have to
    explicitly enable these.
  * create classes or modules.
  * access to Python's :py:func:`eval`, :py:func:`getattr`, :py:func:`hasattr`,
      :py:func:`setattr`, and    :py:func:`delattr`.
  * accessing object attributes that begin and end with `__`, the so-called
    ``dunder`` attributes.  This will include (but is not limited to
    `__globals__`, `__code__`, `__func__`, `__self__`, `__module__`,
    `__dict__`, `__class__`, `__call__`, and `__getattribute__`.  None of
    these can be accessed for any object.

In addition (and following the discussion in the link above), the following
attributes are blacklisted for all objects, and cannot be accessed:

   `func_globals`, `func_code`, `func_closure`, `im_class`, `im_func`, `im_self`,
   `gi_code`, `gi_frame`, `f_locals`

While this approach of making a blacklist cannot be guaranteed to be complete,
it does eliminate entire classes of attacks known to be able to seg-fault the
Python interpreter.

An important caveat is that asteval will typically expose numpy ufuncs from the
numpy module. Several of these can seg-fault Python without too much trouble.
If you are paranoid about safe user input that can never cause a segmentation
fault, you may want to consider disabling the use of numpy, or take extra care
to specify what can be used.

There are important categories of safety that asteval does not even attempt
to address. The most important of these is resource hogging, which might be
used for a denial-of-service attack.  There is no guaranteed timeout on any
calculation, and so a reasonable looking calculation such as::

   from asteval import Interpreter
   aeval = Interpreter()
   txt = """nmax = 1e8
   a = sqrt(arange(nmax))
   """
   aeval.eval(txt)

can take a noticeable amount of CPU time.  It is not hard to come up with short
program that would run for hundreds of years, which probably exceeds anyones
threshold for an acceptable run-time.  There simply is not a good way to
predict how long any code will take to run from the text of the code itself.
As a simple example, consider the expression `x**y**z`.  For values `x=y=z=5`,
the run time will be well under 0.001 seconds.  For `x=y=z=8`, run time will
still be under 1 sec.  Changing to `x=8, y=9, z=9`, will cause the statement to
take several seconds.  With `x=y=z=9`, executing that statement may take more
than 1 hour on some machines.  In short, runtime cannot be determined
lexically.  To be clear, for this exponentiation example, Asteval will raise a
runtime error, telling you that an exponent > 10,000 is not allowed.  But that
happens at runtime, after the value of the exponent has been evaluated, it does
not happen by looking at the text of the code. That is, there may very well be
other "clever ways" to have very long run times that cannot be readily predicted
from the text.

The exponential example also demonstrates there is not a good way to check for
a long-running calculation within a single Python process.  That calculation is
not stuck within the Python interpreter, but in C code (no doubt the `pow()`
function) called by the Python interpreter itself.  That call will not return
to the Python interpreter or allow other threads to run until that call is
done.  That means that from within a single process, there would not be a
reliable way to tell `asteval` (or really, even Python) when a calculation has
taken too long: Denial of Service is hard to detect before it happens, and even
challenging to detect while it is happening.  The only reliable way to limit
run time is to have a second process watching the execution time of the asteval
process and either try to interrupt it or kill it.

For a limited range of problems, you can try to avoid asteval taking too
long.  For example, you may try to limit the *recursion limit* when
executing expressions, with a code like this::

    import contextlib

    @contextlib.contextmanager
    def limited_recursion(recursion_limit):
        old_limit = sys.getrecursionlimit()
        sys.setrecursionlimit(recursion_limit)
        try:
            yield
        finally:
            sys.setrecursionlimit(old_limit)

    with limited_recursion(100):
        Interpreter().eval(...)

A secondary security concern is that the default list of supported functions
does include Python's `open()` which will allow disk access to the untrusted
user.  If `numpy` is supported, its `load()` and `loadtxt()` functions will
also normally be supported.  Including these functions does not elevate
permissions, but it does allow the user of the `asteval` interpreter to read
files with the privileges of the calling program.  In some cases, this may not
be desirable, and you may want to remove some of these functions from the
symbol table, re-implement them, or ensure that your program cannot access
information on disk that should be kept private.

In summary, while asteval attempts to be safe and is definitely safer than
using :py:func:`eval`, there may be ways that using asteval could lead to
increased risk of malicious use.  Recommendations for how to improve this
situation would be greatly appreciated.
