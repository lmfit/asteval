ASTEVAL: Minimal Python AST Evaluator
================================================

.. _numpy: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy

The asteval package evaluates Python expressions and statements, providing
a safer alternative to Python's builtin :py:func:`eval` and a richer,
easier to use alternative to :py:func:`ast.literal_eval`.  It does this by
building an embedded interpreter for a subset of the Python language using
Python's :py:mod:`ast` module.  The emphasis and main area of application
is the evaluation of mathematical expressions. Because of this emphasis,
mathematical functions from Python's :py:mod:`math` module are built-in to
asteval, and a large number of functions from `numpy`_ will be available if
`numpy`_ is installed on your system.

While the primary goal is evaluation of mathematical expressions, many
features and constructs of the Python language are supported by default.
These features include array slicing and subscripting, if-then-else
conditionals, while loops, for loops, try-except blocks, list
comprehension, and user-defined functions.  All objects in the asteval
interpreter are truly Python objects, and all of the basic built-in data
structures (strings, dictionaries, tuple, lists, sets, numpy arrays) are
supported, including the built-in methods for these objects.

However, asteval is by no means an attempt to reproduce Python with its own
:py:mod:`ast` module.  There are important differences and missing features
compared to Python.  Many of these absences are intentional, and part of
the effort to try to make a safer version of :py:func:`eval`, while some
are simply due to the reduced requirements for an embedded mini-language.
These differences and absences include:

 1. Variable and function symbol names are held in a simple symbol
    table, giving a flat namespace.
 2. creating classes is not allowed.
 3. importing modules is not allowed, unless specifically enabled.
 4. decorators, generators, type hints, and `lambda` are not supported.
 5. `yield`, `await`,  and async programming are not supported.
 6. Many builtin functions (:py:func:`eval`, :py:func:`getattr`,
    :py:func:`hasattr`, :py:func:`setattr`, and :py:func:`delattr`) are not allowed.
 7. Accessing many object attributes that can provide access to
    the python interpreter are not allowed.

The resulting "asteval language" acts very much like miniature version of
Python, focused on mathematical calculations, and with noticeable limitations.
It is the kind of toy programming language you might use to introduce simple
scientific programming concepts, but also includes much of the standard Python
features to be a reasonably complete language and not too restricted from what
someone familiar with Python would expect.

Because asteval is designed for evaluating user-supplied input, safety
against malicious or incompetent user input is an important concern.
Asteval tries as hard as possible to prevent user-supplied input from
crashing the Python interpreter or from returning exploitable parts of the
Python interpreter.  In this sense asteval is certainly safer than using
:py:func:`eval`.  However, asteval is an open source project written by
volunteers, and we cannot guarantee that it is completely safe against
malicious attacks.
